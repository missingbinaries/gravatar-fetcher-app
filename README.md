# Gravatar Fetcher
A smol app that fetches gravatars. 

Uses HTML5, Flask and LibGravatar.

## Contributions
Contributions are always accepted, big or small. I really need the help right now. (cc [#1](https://github.com/ry0id/smol-gravatar-app/issues/1))

## Setup
Run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` and then `py app.py` and go to the URL that's returned (should be `127.0.0.1` with port `8080` since this is being done locally).
